We have a whole .py file that handles all the data formatting. The actual model training and implementation is done in the
MovieRatings notebook. To run the three models, simply just run the entire notebook file. We have included various tests for each 
model including tests in the training set and tests in the test set.

The program doesn't have any bugs and should run perfectly on the first try. If it doesn't, then please contact Parker Hague, Dax Jones, 
or Steven Mikels.
